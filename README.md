  ## Useage
As this program is a back-end database, the repository needs to be downloaded and seeded. Users can use this program to keep track of data for users, friends, comments and reactions. Users are able to create, edit, retreive and delete users via Insomnia or other software that is able to parse apis. It is also able to link two users togther as friends, log, edit, retreive and delete thoughts for each user and add and remove reactions to those thoughts.
